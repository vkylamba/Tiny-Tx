# üß™ Low-Power One-Way Wireless Energy Meter

This is a **minimalist, low-power, single-channel energy meter** designed for **AC/DC voltage and current monitoring**, using:

- **ATtiny85 microcontroller** (3.3‚ÄØV, 8‚ÄØMHz)
- **WCS1500 Hall-effect sensor** for current
- **Voltage divider** for high-voltage AC/DC measurement
- **FS1000A ASK RF module** for one-way wireless transmission (100m+ range)
- **3.7‚ÄØV Li-ion battery** with **LDO regulator**
- **EEPROM storage** for persistent energy tracking

> üõ†Ô∏è The entire system is designed for long-term deployment with replaceable battery, no LCD, no charging, and ultra-low power use.

## üîß Features

- Measures **bidirectional voltage and current** (AC/DC)
- Calculates **power and cumulative energy (Wh)**
- Transmits data wirelessly every 5 minutes (ASK, 433‚ÄØMHz)
- Stores total energy in **internal EEPROM**
- Powered by a single **Li-ion battery** with **3+ months of battery life**
- Fully open-source and easily modifiable

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) in VSCode  
2. Connect your **ATtiny85** via USB programmer (e.g. USBasp or USBtinyISP)  
3. Clone this repo and run:

   ```bash
   pio run
   pio upload
   ```

4. Receiver (FS1000A) should be tuned to 433‚ÄØMHz and decode message format.
